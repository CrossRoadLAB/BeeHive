## GENERAL INFORMATION

**BeeHive** is a development board equipped with ESP32-S3-WROOM-1, a general purpose Wi-Fi + Bluetooth LE MCU module that integrates full Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE functions (datasheet). The "heart" of BeeHive is an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module (PCB antenna) with 8 MB of Flash and 8 MB of PSRAM. The ESP32-S3 SoC features a 32-bit Xtensa® LX7 CPU running at up to 240 MHz and a (low-power) coprocessor that can be used to constantly monitor peripherals if needed, after shutting down the CPU. The ESP32-S3 integrates a rich set of peripherals including SPI, LCD, camera interface, UART, I2C, I2S, remote control, pulse counter, PWM LED, USB Serial / JTAG controller, MCPWM, SDIO host, GDMA, TWAI controller ® (compatible with ISO 11898-1), ADC, touch sensor, temperature sensor, timer and watchdog, as well as up to 45 GPIOs. It also includes a USB 1.1 OTG interface (USB1 and USB2).
There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:
- USB-UART port and ESP32-S3 USB port (one or both), default power supply (recommended)
- Pin 5V and GND
- Pin 3v3 and GND
